# Abstract

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate use of SpecFEM2D for forward modeling.
Several examples were provided but students were encouraged to deviate
from the fixed cases and create their own examples.

Specifically, the assigment asks for the following:

1- figures of your model, source-receiver configuration and the computed seismograms,

2- the parameter file you used during your simulations,

3- the resolution of your simulations (i.e., minim resolvable period by your mesh),

4- what kind of seismic source you use,

5- are you using the numerical solver in the SH or P-SV mode.

6- what phases you observe on your seismograms.

7- the corner frequencies of your band-pass or low-pass filter.

8- your interpretation and comments.

The remaining sections of this document described a unique model developed
by the author and address requested points.

# Model Development

I developed the following model based on the default example included in
the SpecFEM2D repository. However, I modified the model geometry, grid size,
source parameters, and material properties to gain an understanding of the
various input options. @fig-model shows the model, source geometry, and receiver
geometry which the following sections describe in more detail.

## Material Properties

The 2D model is composed of three elastic materials which have the following properties: (@tbl-materials)

| Material  | $\rho (\frac{kg}{m^3})$ | $V_p (\frac{m}{s})$ | $V_s (\frac{m}{s})$ |
|:---------:|:-----------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
|     1     |          2,700          |        3,000        |        1,800        |
|     2     |          2,500          |        2,700        |        1,500        |
|     3     |          2,200          |        2,500        |        1,400        |

Material attenuation was disabled.

## Geometry and Grid Discretization

The model is a basic layered-cake model with flat interfaces between boundaries
with hypothetical topography applied in the most shallow layer.

The Total model extents are 4000m in the x direction and the Z extents
range from $\approx$ 3000m to 3350m depending on the topography. The total number
of elements in the x direction in 100 and in the z direction is 75. This means
each element is approximately 40m by 40m.

## Boundary Conditions

Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) boundary conditions with 3 element thickness on all
sides. The default attenuation parameters were left unchanged from the default
parameters file.

## Source

An elastic force angled 30 degrees counter-clockwise was used as the seismic source.
The source was located at x=2000m and z=1500m. A Ricker (2nd derivative of Gaussian)
source-time function was selected with a dominant frequency of 8Hz. This gives an
approximate maximum source frequency of 20Hz, which is the maximum recommended
frequency suggested by the SpecFEM2D output.

## Receivers

Eleven evenly spaced receivers were located on the surface, starting at x=300m
and ending at x=2700m (@fig-model). Their Z coordinate varies depending on the
topography.

# Simulation Parameters

There were 25 nodes per element, corresponding to approximately 5 in each
direction. However, since GLLs are not evenly spaced, the average spacing
(as reported by SpecFEM2D) is 9.98m and the minimum spacing is 6.89m.

The simulation is run in P-SV mode rather than SH/membrane wave mode. It is
Cartesian Planar simulation.

## CFL Stability

Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy Stability Condition [CFL, @de2013courant] requires the
physical velocity is bounded by the model, or numerical, velocity. More formally,
it requires the following condition is met:

$$
C \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \le 1
$${#eq-clf}

Where C is the velocity (m/s), $\Delta x$ is the model spacing and $\Delta t$
is the model time step.

For this simulation, a reasonable time-step of 1.0e-3 seconds was selected
then the CFL stability assessed.

For spectral elements, calculating @eq-clf correctly depends on more than just
the element size. The time stepping algorithm, boundary conditions, and several
other factors must also be considered (see the SpecFEM2D manual: How to choose the time step).

However, to approximate CLF limit in a less precise way, the minimum GLL spacing,
the maximum model velocity, and the specified time step can be used.

$$
CLF_{approx} \approx C_{max}  \frac{1.0e-3 s}{6.89 m} \approx  3000 (m/s) \frac{1.0e-3}{6.89m}
\approx 0.44
$$

Which is close the value reported by the SpecFEM2D output of 0.43. Since the reported value is
less than the recommended max (0.5) there shouldn't be any stability issues
related to the CFL condition.

## Wavelength Resolution

Another important simulation consideration is wavelength resolution. SpecFEM2D
recommends an average number of GLLs per wavelength of 4.5 for S waves and
5.5 for P waves. This constraint is, of course, governed by the mesh spacing
and the lowest material velocity.

The distribution of GLLs per S-wavelength is shown in @fig-GLL-histogram. IN all
cases, the minimum of 4.5 is exceeded.

# Results

Figures @fig-xtraces and @fig-ztraces show the synthetic seismograms plotted as
function of time and source-receiver distance. The seismograms calculated by
SpecFEM2D were first filtered before displaying to remove frequencies outside the
resolvable range of the model. A simple Butterworth bandpass filter was used with
minium frequency of 0.05Hz and a maximum of 20Hz as implemented in ObsPy
[@krischer2015obspy]. These frequencies were indicated
as the minimum and maximum resolvable frequencies by the SpecFEM2D output.

The P (first arrival) and S (second arrival) are both quite prominent.Later on there
are also weaker phases which are discussed later on.

# Discussion

Because potential stability and resolution issues were addressed, the simulation
worked without major issues. The produced seismograms are reasonable, and a clear
P-S separation is observable which, as expected, increases with source-receiver
distance. It is more difficult, however, to interpret the other features in the
seismogram, which could correspond to reflections, refractions, and,
perhaps, the beginning of Rayleigh wave formation (although typically larger
source-receiver distance is required for surface waves to form).

# Supplemental Materials

The input files for this simulation, as well as jpeg images showing progression
of the simulation at various points in time, are attached as supplemental
material in the assignment submission.
